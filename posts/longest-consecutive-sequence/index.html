<h2 id="problem-explanation">Problem Explanation</h2>
<p>The question provides you with an unsorted array and you need to find the longest consecutive sequence within it. This sequence can appear not in order. Furthermore, the question states that we need to do this in O(n) time.</p>
<h2 id="initial-thoughts">Initial Thoughts</h2>
<p>At first glance the only thing that makes this problem non-trivial is the time requirement. O(n). Sorting the list would make the question much easier but since that is a O(nlogn) operation that is not an option. Furthermore, looking up the successor of each element doesn&rsquo;t have a good enough stopping condition to make it any better than O(n^2).</p>
<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>One key to this question is that if an element occurs more than once that does not affect the solution. This means we can use a set rather than a list</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python">nums <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> set(nums)
</code></pre></div><p>This gives us two advantages. Sets have fewer elements in them than lists as all duplicates have been removed and all set operations can be done in O(1) time as a concequence of the hashing protocol that sets use. You can read more about that <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity">here</a>.
However, if we have a list in reverse order and we check the sublist starting on each element we will end up having to go through the elements n^2 times.<br>
The answer is to check if an element is the start of a consecutive sequence or within one. If it&rsquo;s the start we can find the length of the sequence the element begins, if not we can move to the next element.
Each time we should compare the length of our consecutive sequence with our longest sequence so far and update our longest variable.</p>
